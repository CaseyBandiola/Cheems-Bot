# Cheems-Bot
I just did this for fun. This is the code for a Cheems Bot in Discord.

# Commands
```
  $cheems_say "....."
```
  - Cheems will iterate through each word of the input string
  - Cheems looks at the first instance of a vowel and consonant combination, with the additional constraint that the consonant is not the letter 'm'
  - Cheems inserts an 'm' in between the vowel and consonant
